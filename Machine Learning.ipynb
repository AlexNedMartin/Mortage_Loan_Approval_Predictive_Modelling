    "- **Logistic Regression**: Train = 68%, Test = 65%\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Forest**:\n",
    "   - High training accuracy (85%) but relatively lower test accuracy (71%), indicating possible overfitting.\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "   - Similar training and test accuracy (68% and 65%), indicating good generalization but lower overall accuracy.\n",
    "3. **SVM**:\n",
    "   - Similar training and test accuracy (69% and 65%), like logistic regression, it generalizes well but with lower accuracy.\n",
    "4. **XGBoost**:\n",
    "   - Balanced performance (75% training, 70% test), suggesting good generalization with higher accuracy than logistic regression and SVM.\n",
    "5. **LightGBM**:\n",
    "   - Balanced performance (76% training, 71% test), indicating good generalization and slightly better accuracy compared to XGBoost.\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",

    "**LightGBM** appears to be the best model based on the provided accuracy scores, as it has the highest test accuracy (71%) with a reasonably close training accuracy (76%), suggesting it generalizes well without overfitting.\n"
